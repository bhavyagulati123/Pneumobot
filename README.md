**Pneumobot â€“ Early Pneumonia Diagnosis System with chatbot (for question answering)**  

*Date: [02-08-2024]*

**Description:**  
Developed a machine learning model to diagnose pneumonia at an early stage using chest X-ray images. Integrated advanced Visual Language Models (VLMs) and a custom scoring system to enhance diagnostic accuracy and response quality. Adding the interface development aspect makes your project even more accessible and user-friendly so we have done that too using Grado !!

**Key Contributions:**
- Utilized the 'paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia' dataset from Kaggle for training and testing the model.
- Implemented a scoring system to dynamically decide whether to utilize custom prompts or Google's Gemini for generating the most accurate and relevant diagnostic responses.
- Leveraged Google Colab for model training, fine-tuning, and experimentation, ensuring efficient use of computational resources.
- Achieved [mention any key results, such as accuracy, F1-score, or other relevant metrics].
- Integrated the model with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for non-technical users to obtain early pneumonia diagnoses.
- Gradio for UI/UX
**Tools & Technologies:**
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Google Colab
- Gemini, Custom Prompt Engineering
- Data Handling and Preprocessing with Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Impact:**
- Enhanced early detection of pneumonia, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis.
- Created a scalable and adaptable system that could be expanded to diagnose other conditions using similar methodologies.
